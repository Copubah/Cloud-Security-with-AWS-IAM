# Cloud-Security-with-AWS-IAM
- Cloud security is critical when working with AWS, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) is one of the foundational services for controlling who can access AWS resources
- AWS IAM provides fine-grained control over permissions and access to ensure that users, groups, and services have only the necessary rights, adhering to the principle of least privilege



## Key concepts
- IAM Users:a person or application that needs access to AWS services, Users can be assigned policies that define what AWS resources they can access and what actions they can perform
- IAM Roles:are similar to users but do not have long-term credentials associated with them 
- IAM Policies:Policies are JSON documents that define permissions and access to resources,policies can be Managed or Inline policies.
- IAM Groups:Groups simplify user management by allowing you to assign policies to a group of users at once
